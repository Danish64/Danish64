# Hi, I'm Danish 👋  

**Full Stack Engineer** —  **Concepts** Over Technologies.  
For me, good engineering is about clarity of design, predictable systems, and user experience that feels effortless.

### 🛠 Core Focus  
- **Frontend:** React/Next.js, TypeScript.
- **Backend:** Node/Express/Hono - GraphQL/REST/gRPC APIs, WebSockets, SSE.
- **Databases:** SQL/Postgres/MongoDB.
- **System Design:** Learning System Designs Fundamentals.
- **Deployments** CI/CD with GitHub Actions, AWS ECS (Fargate), S3, CloudFront, EC2,  Docker, PM2 for process management.
- **Monitoring & Reliability:** AWS CloudWatch, Sentry, Replay, PM2 — For observability and feedbacks.

### 🔍 How I Work  
- **50% Communication** — align, document, and make sure teams understand the *why*.  
- **20% Implementation** — write maintainable code that respects abstractions.  
- **30% Testing & Observability** — Playwright, Jest, Supertest, k6, AWS CloudWatch, Sentry with Replay, to see what users actually experience.

### 📂 Highlights  
- Built **trading systems** with live execution updates and market movement alerts.  
- Helped engineered a **2D home-mapping canvas tool** with Pixi.js, handling complex layouts and interactions with custom types.  
- Developed **Next.js blogs with SSR**, improving reach and SEO visibility.

### 🚀 Frontend Expertise  
- React/Next.js specialist — from **Webpack bundling** to **advanced component design patterns** (Compound Components, HOC, Render Props).  
- Performance-driven — code splitting, lazy loading, route prefetching, and DevTools-first debugging.  
- State management with **SWR, React Query, Zustand, XState** — keeping data flows predictable and fast both server side states and client side.  
- Browser-level understanding — optimizing **LCP, CLS, FID**; crafting smooth **60fps animations** with FLIP & Framer Motion.  
- Accessibility & SEO — semantic HTML, ARIA, logical tab orders, skip links.  

### ⚙️ Backend & Systems  
- REST/gRPC APIs, WebSockets, SSE — designed for scale and real-time feedback.  
- PostgreSQL tuning, caching strategies.  
- CI/CD with GitHub Actions, AWS ECS (Fargate), Docker, PM2 for process management.  
- Monitoring & alerting — Bash scripts + metrics (CPU, memory, queues, logs).
